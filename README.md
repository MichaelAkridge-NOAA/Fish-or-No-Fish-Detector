# Yes Fish / No Fish Detector
Is there a fish üêü or not?  Detect vulnerable marine ecosystems(corals, crinoids, sponges, and fish.) Uses the [FathomNet VME Model](https://huggingface.co/FathomNet/vulnerable-marine-ecosystems) for object detection in marine ecosystems, specifically focusing on corals, crinoids, sponges, and fish. It is built on top of the **Ultralytics YOLOv8x** model, providing fast and accurate object detection capabilities.

## Features
- Upload one or more images to detect vulnerable marine ecosystems.
- Adjust the confidence threshold for predictions.
- Download all detection and bounding box results in JSON format.
