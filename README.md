## Model Details
Model trained to detect fish in underwater Grayscale Imagery using the YOLOv8n architecture for performance. The model leverages unsupervised learning techniques to learn patterns and identify fish without relying on fully labeled datasets.Uses the [FathomNet VME Model](https://huggingface.co/FathomNet/vulnerable-marine-ecosystems) for object detection in marine ecosystems, specifically focusing on corals, crinoids, sponges, and fish in its unsupervised learning method. It is built on top of the [Ultralytics YOLOv8x model](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/), providing fast and accurate object detection capabilities.
